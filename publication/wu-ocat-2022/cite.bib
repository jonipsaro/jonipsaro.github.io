  abstract  = "Tuft cells are a rare chemosensory lineage that coordinates
               immune and neural responses to foreign pathogens in mucosal
               tissues1. Recent studies have also revealed tuft-cell-like human
               tumours2,3, particularly as a variant of small-cell lung cancer.
               Both normal and neoplastic tuft cells share a genetic
               requirement for the transcription factor POU2F3 (refs. 2,4),
               although the transcriptional mechanisms that generate this cell
               type are poorly understood. Here we show that binding of POU2F3
               to the uncharacterized proteins C11orf53 and COLCA2 (renamed
               here OCA-T1/POU2AF2 and OCA-T2/POU2AF3, respectively) is
               critical in the tuft cell lineage. OCA-T1 and OCA-T2 are
               paralogues of the B-cell-specific coactivator OCA-B; all three
               proteins are encoded in a gene cluster and contain a conserved
               peptide that binds to class II POU transcription factors and a
               DNA octamer motif in a bivalent manner. We demonstrate that
               binding between POU2F3 and OCA-T1 or OCA-T2 is essential in
               tuft-cell-like small-cell lung cancer. Moreover, we generated
               OCA-T1-deficient mice, which are viable but lack tuft cells in
               several mucosal tissues. These findings reveal that the
               POU2F3-OCA-T complex is the master regulator of tuft cell
               identity and a molecular vulnerability of tuft-cell-like
               small-cell lung cancer.",
