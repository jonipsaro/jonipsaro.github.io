Despite the similar affinities of their chromodomains for di- and tri-methylated histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9me2/3), different HP1 proteins exhibit distinct chromatin-binding patterns, likely due to interactions with various specificity factors. Previously, we showed that the chromatin-binding pattern of the HP1 protein Rhino, a crucial factor of the Drosophila PIWI-interacting RNA (piRNA) pathway, is largely defined by a DNA sequence-specific C2H2 zinc finger protein named Kipferl (Baumgartner et al., 2022). Here, we elucidate the molecular basis of the interaction between Rhino and its guidance factor Kipferl. Through phylogenetic analyses, structure prediction, and in vivo genetics, we identify a single amino acid change within Rhino's chromodomain, G31D, that does not affect H3K9me2/3 binding but disrupts the interaction between Rhino and Kipferl. Flies carrying the rhinoG31D mutation phenocopy kipferl mutant flies, with Rhino redistributing from piRNA clusters to satellite repeats, causing pronounced changes in the ovarian piRNA profile of rhinoG31D flies. Thus, Rhino's chromodomain functions as a dual-specificity module, facilitating interactions with both a histone mark and a DNA-binding protein.","tags":["Chromatin","Genetics","ITC","Kipferl","Light Scattering","MALLS","Rhino","Zinc Finger"],"title":"Evolutionary adaptation of an HP1-protein chromodomain integrates chromatin and DNA sequence signals","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Zhe Qian","Dongyan Song","**Jonathan J.

Receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase delta (RPTPδ/PTPRD) has been shown to elicit tumor-promoting functions, including elevating SRC activity and promoting metastasis in certain cell contexts. Dimerization has been implicated in the inhibition of receptor protein tyrosine phosphatases (RPTPs). We have generated antibodies targeting PTPRD ectodomains, with the goal of manipulating their dimerization status ectopically, thereby regulating intracellular signaling. We have validated antibody binding to endogenous PTPRD in a metastatic breast cancer cell line, CAL51, and demonstrated that a monoclonal antibody, RD-43, inhibited phosphatase activity and induced the degradation of PTPRD. Similar effects were observed following chemically-induced dimerization of its phosphatase domain. Mechanistically, RD-43 triggered the formation of PTPRD dimers in which the phosphatase activity was impaired. Subsequently, the mAb-PTPRD-dimer complex was degraded through lysosomal and proteasomal pathways, independently of secretase cleavage. Consequently, treatment with RD-43 inhibited SRC signaling and suppressed PTPRD-dependent cell invasion. Together, these findings demonstrate that manipulating RPTP function via antibodies to the extracellular segments has therapeutic potential.","tags":["PTPRD","ECD","Antibody","Biophysics"],"title":"Manipulating PTPRD function with ectodomain antibodies","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Seung Cho Lee*","Dexter W.

We show that DDM1 promotes replacement of histone variant H3.3 by H3.1. In ddm1 mutants, DNA methylation is partly restored by loss of the H3.3 chaperone HIRA, while the H3.1 chaperone CAF-1 becomes essential. The single-particle cryo-EM structure at 3.2 Å of DDM1 with a variant nucleosome reveals engagement with histone H3.3 near residues required for assembly, and with the unmodified H4 tail. An N-terminal autoinhibitory domain inhibits, while a disulfide bond in the helicase domain supports activity. DDM1 co-localizes with H3.1 and H3.3 during the cell cycle, and with the DNA methyltransferase MET1/Dnmt1, but is blocked by H4K16 acetylation. The male germline H3.3 variant MGH3/HTR10 is resistant to remodeling by DDM1 and acts as a placeholder nucleosome in sperm cells for epigenetic inheritance.","tags":["DDM1","nucleosome","epigenetic","cryo-EM"],"title":"Chromatin remodeling of histone H3 variants by DDM1 underlies epigenetic inheritance of DNA methylation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jonathan Ipsaro"],"categories":[],"content":"Overview Setting up data collection can be divided into these main steps:\n GIF Tuning Non-CDS Gain Reference Collection Image Shift Calibration Atlas Generation Set Up the EPU Session CDS Gain Reference Collection Manual ZLP Centering Perform Direct Alignments Final Touches  Step 1 - Tune the GIF (optional)  Using the microscope computer, set the Condenser Aperture to 150.

If the GIF tuning fails completely or if the image is very colorful, it may be due to a beam intensity that is is too low. Reinsert the screen, increase the intensity, and try again.  Step 2 - Non-CDS Gain Reference Collection (optional) CRITICAL: For Gain Reference Collection, Data Acquisition parameters must already be set and the ZLP should be centered. ZLP centering is performed as part of the GIF tuning protocol, so the ZLP is likely already centered.Also note that during the automatic ZLP centering, the Gatan camera is taken out of CDS mode (if it was previously in CDS mode). For the initial gain references, you DO NOT want to be in CDS mode.  Navigate to an empty grid square. Check that the acquisiton parameters in EPU are reasonable. Preparation  Data Acquisition  Preview On the microscope computer, set the Aperture to 150. Using the microscope control panel, set the spot size to 2. On the microscope computer, insert the screen and check for fringes. If fringes are present, adjust the beam intensity using the control panel knobs and the beam position using the track ball. Gain references will need to be collected in both counted and linear modes. Adjust the Gatan camera settings to be Low Dose, Counted, 0.5x. Note: If the camera is set to Counted then the gain reference acquisition will automatically advance from counted to linear mode. If the camera is set to Linear, only the linear gain references will be collected. That is not what you want. Prepare gain references on the Gatan Computer. Camera  Prepare Gain Reference. Follow the instructions when prompted by the Gatan Computer. You will need to adjust the beam intensity. Use the numbers on the Gatan display and adjust to the required value. Manually check the beam centering by inserting the screen. If needed (i.e. the beam center is very far off), adjust the beam center postion by selecting Direct Alignments  Beamshift Center on the microscope computer and adjusting the beam position with multifunction X and multifunction Y on the control pad. Center on the green circle. Retract the screen. After the first set (linear) of gain references have been collected, make sure to re-set the Data Acquisition settings display for EPU. Click Set. Note: The spot size should change back to 5 and the objective aperture should automatically change to 100 um if it was not already at 100 um and the C2 aperture should return to 70. After the linear gain references have been collected, the counted mode gain reference collection window will appear. Check Expert Mode and make sure the Dose Rate is set to 10.0 and the Gain Ref Electron is at 3000. Click OK. Follow the instructions when prompted by the Gatan Computer (similar to before). You will need to adjust the beam intensity. Use the numbers on the Gatan display and adjust to the required value. When the gain reference is completed, open the Gatan camera. View. Set the view to 1x. Also activate the FFT window. Both the main window and the FFT should be decently flat however with the latest acquisition setups the gain reference is not applied. Any imperfections in the image should be reflected by a similar pattern in the gain reference. Set the Data Acquisition parameters by clicking Set.  Step 3 - Image Shift Calibration CRITICAL: For the Image Shift Calibration, it is obligatory that all Preparation modes (Atlas at 175x, Grid Square, Hole/Eucentric Height, Data Acquisition/Auto Focus) are already set. Part 1 - Grid Square Selection Note: This square will take a fair amount of radiation damage, so it is important that it is not a square that you plan to use for data acqusition. A square that has a few empty holes and some interestingly-shaped contamination is ideal. Part 2 - Locate and Navigate to a Landmark  Navigate to Preparation  Atlas. Select a grid square that has an obvious landmark. Usually a piece of contaimination with a distinctive shape is desirable. If collecting on Lacey carbon grids, contamination near to an interesting carbon pattern is even better. Move the stage to that grid square and landmark. (Right click) Move stage here. Check the grid square. Preparation  Grid Square  Preview. Determine the eucentric height Auto Functions  Hole/Eucentric Height  Auto-eucentric by beam tilt. Set the microscope parameters to match the Data Acqusition settings. Preparation  Data Acquisition  Set. Sequentially center the stage position on the landmark at each magnification setting, ending with Data Acquisition.  Part 3 - Perform Image Shift Calibration  Select Preparation  Tasks  Calibrate Image Shifts  Start Calibration. The Image Shift Calibration module will walk through the calibration. To continue, click Proceed. When a new setting is applied and an image is generated, adjust the calibration center by double-clicking on the corresponding spot on the right image panel. It is advisable to re-acquire this image before moving on. When satisfied, click Proceeed. This will walk through each magnification setting, beginning from Data Acquisition and continuing through to Atlas.  Step 4 - Generate the Atlas  Select Atlas  Session Setup. Enter a path for the data (the folder will be created automatically). Images should be saved as MRC format. Double-check the Atlas acquisition parameters Preparation  Atlas. For screening, a magnification 135x of is used to increase speed. For data collection atlases, a magnification of 175x is preferred. Select the grid to be atlased. Ensure that the objective aperture it out. Begin the atlas acquisition by clicking Start.  Step 5 - Set up the EPU Session  Select EPU  Session Setup. Enter the setup parameters. Enter a path for the data (the folder will be created automatically). Image format should be saved as MRC format. The Dose fraction output should be Tiff Lzw Non-gain normalized. Make sure that the acqusition type is Manual and Faster. Make sure to select the correct grid type and indicate the hole paramters (if applicable). Still in the EPU window, use the Atlas tab to select a reasonable grid square. Determine the eucentric height. Select Preparation  Hole/Eucentric Height  Auto Eucentric Height by beam tilt. Note: Our microscope has a slight systematic error of about 2.5 um for the typical parameters. Manually adjust the Z height using the microscope computer Stage  Set  Z (subtract 2.5 microns)  Go To. It can be useful to take an image of an empty hole in the grid for subsequent determination of approximate ice thickness. This can be done by centering on the empty hole, then selecting Preparation  Data Acquisition  Acquire. Note the dose (lower right window). Check the grid square quality. Move to a hole that could be potenially useful for collection. Then collect an image Preparation  Data Acquisition  Acquire. If the ice thickness is appropriate (usually ~80% of the empty hole dose is desireable), this square can be used for data collection. EPU  Atlas  (Right Click on Grid Square) Add Square. Generate the pattern of images to be collected. EPU  Hole Selection  Generate Pattern. Use the brush too to manually remove i) empty holes/regions, ii) significant contamination, iii) thick ice near the edges of each grid square. Some of this can be automated using the controls in the top and right panels. Note: If you intend on using the automatic hole selection (recommended), be very stringent in setting the cutoff values in the histogram! Add the collection and focus parameters. Defocus values that are typically used begin around -2.2 microns and continue to -0.8 microns. To add these, enter the desired defocus value and click on the 📄 icon next to the entry field. It should now be present in the defocus values list above. Valeus can be removed by selecting them and clicking on the 🗑️ icon. Be sure to double check these and ensure that the values are negative! Set the following parameters for Lacey carbon grids:  Image Shift Delay = 1.5 seconds Minimum stage settling time = 12 seconds Recurrance = After Distance = 10 microns Focus using = Objective lens   Alternatively, set the following parameters for Quantifoil grids:  Delay after Image Shift = 1.5 seconds Delay after Stage Shift = 1 second Recurrance = After Distance = 10 um Focus = Objective lens   If collecting from Lacey grids, use the EPU  Generate Template to tile the grid square. Use a spacing of 1.2 um. If collecting from Quantifoil grids, beam shift collection can dramatically speed up acquisiton. Use the EPU  Generate Template to set this up. Be sure to include one shot for Autofocus. If you are unsure how to make an appropriate template, ask the Facility Manager. Return to the EPU  Atlas view. The grid square should now display the eucentric height determined earlier and the number of images to be collected should be indicated in the right-most panel. Option 1 - Automatic (preferred): Return to the Atlas view (EPU  Preparation  Square Selection) select more squares that look good for acquisition. Once finished, go to EPU  Preparation  Hole Selection  Prepare All Squares. Option 2 - Manual: Repeat this process beginning at item 3. It is not necessary to re-enter the collection (item 9) as these should be preserved from earlier, but remember to update the Z-height after determining the eucentric height for each square. Continue adding more grid squares until there are enough for the desired collection time.  Step 6 - Manual Centering of the ZLP (optional) IMPORTANT: Centering the ZLP will disable CDS mode without notification. If centering the ZLP, make sure to double-check that CDS mode is enabled afterward.  Make sure the Data Acquisition parameters are set and active. Adjust the Gatan camera settings to be Low Dose, Linear, 1x. Make sure the camera is active by clicking View. On the Gatan computer open the Filter Control window. Click on the text field Filter Control  Main  Adjust  X.X eV. Using the arrow keys (up and down), adjust the ZLP position. Make sure to count how many times you click in a given direction. Move in the up direction. You should eventually find the edge of the ZLP as the camera image will have aberrations. This is usually 10-14 clicks. Now navigate using the down arrow key back into the slit and to the bottom edge (while counting). Navigate back up into the slit to make up half of the distance. Example: If it took 24 clicks from the 'top' edge of the slit to the 'bottom' edge of the slit, navigate back 12 times to center the slit. Click the O button to the left of the adjustment text box to set this current slit position to 0. CRITICAL: Make sure to put the camera back in Counted, 0.5.  Step 7 - CDS Mode Gain Reference Collection CRITICAL: For Gain Reference Collection, Data Acquisition parameters must already be set and the ZLP should be centered. This time, do NOT center the ZLP using the automatic ZLP centering function on the Gatan computer. Doing so will cause the camera to come out of CDS mode. If you accidentally center the ZLP this way, make sure to reactivate CDS mode as described above.  Make sure the Gatan is set to CDS mode Technique Manager  Low Dose  EF-CCD Camera  Gear Icon (to the right of \"View\"). Make sure to set Corrections: Unprocessed, Correct defects: Checked, CDS Mode: Checked Navigate to an empty grid square. Check that the acquisiton parameters in EPU are reasonable. Preparation  Data Acquisition  Preview On the microscope computer, set the Condenser Aperture to 150. Just select 150. Do NOT click adjust. Using the microscope control panel, set the spot size to 2. On the microscope computer, insert the screen and check for fringes. If fringes are present, adjust the beam intensity using the control panel knobs and the beam position using the track ball. Gain references will need to be collected in both counted and linear modes. Adjust the Gatan camera settings to be Low Dose, Counted, 0.5x. Note: If the camera is set to Counted then the gain reference acquisition will automatically advance from counted to linear mode. If the camera is set to Linear, only the linear gain references will be collected. That is not what you want. Prepare gain references on the Gatan Computer. Camera  Prepare Gain Reference. Follow the instructions when prompted by the Gatan Computer. You will need to adjust the beam intensity. Use the numbers on the Gatan display and adjust to the required value. Manually check the beam centering by inserting the screen. If needed (i.e. the beam center is very far off), adjust the beam center postion by selecting Direct Alignments  Beamshift Center on the microscope computer and adjusting the beam position with multifunction X and multifunction Y on the control pad. Center on the green circle. Retract the screen. After the first set (linear) of gain references have been collected, make sure to re-set the Data Acquisition settings display for EPU. Click Set. Note: The spot size should change back to 5 and the objective aperture should automatically change to 100 um if it was not already at 100 um and the C2 aperture should return to 70. After the linear gain references have been collected, the counted mode gain reference collection window will appear. Check Expert Mode and make sure the Dose Rate is set to 10.0 and the Gain Ref Electron is at 3000. Click OK. Follow the instructions when prompted by the Gatan Computer (similar to before). You will need to adjust the beam intensity. Use the numbers on the Gatan display and adjust to the required value. Set the Data Acquisition parameters by clicking Set. When the gain reference is completed, open the Gatan camera. Set the view to 1x and click View. Also activate the FFT window. Both the main window and the FFT should be decently flat however with the latest acquisition setups the gain reference is not applied. Any imperfections in the image should be reflected by a similar pattern in the gain reference. When statisfied Stop View. Bin and export the CDS gain reference. Navigate to C:/ProgramData/Gatan/ReferenceImages/. There should be two sets of gain references. One set for non-CDS (i.e. 'normal') mode that are rather stable. The other set are for CDS mode and include the ones you just collected. Open the image, then rebin it. Process  Re-bin by Two  Save As.... Make sure NOT to overwrite the original. Change the name following the convention CDSbinnedgainrefMMDDYY.mrc. Save it in the DoseFractions folder. Set the Data Acquisition parameters by clicking Set.Activate the Gatan camera (View), check that the empty image quality is reasonable (although keep in mind that it is not gain corrected), and record the empty dose. This should be something around 14 electrons/pixel/second.  Step 8 - Perform Direct Alignments Part 1 - Grid Square Selection Note: As with the Image Shift Calibration, this square will take a fair amount of radiation damage, so it is important that it is not a square that you plan to use for data acqusition. A square that has a few empty holes and some interestingly-shaped contamination is ideal.  Use EPU to navigate to a new grid square. Move to an empty hole for best contrast. Determine the eucentric height. Auto functions  Hole Eucentric  Eucentric Height by Beam Tilt Position the beam on the edge of an empty hole. This can be done using the EPU controls or by using the joystick on the control panel if the screen is inserted.  Part 2 - Initial Focus Determination Overview: This part of the protocol will serve to tune the eucentric height and find focus. It will be refined in Part 5.\n Insert the screen Set the eucentric height manually Set the microscope optics to the Data Acquisition setting. Preparation  Data Acquisition  SET Use the control panel joystick to move to an area where you can see the edge of the hole and some carbon. Set the alpha angle to +/- 20 degrees. This command can be found on the microscope computer under the Stage menu (lower right corner) in the Control tab. You will need to activate the popout extension from the Stage parameters menu to adjust the alpha angle. The stage should rotate. The goal is to adjust the Z-height of the stage such that changing alpha +/- 20 degrees keeps the center of the image in place. Z-height can be adjusted using the control panel (rightmost buttons). When adjusting the height, it is likely necessary to toggle between alpha=0 and alpha=20. When satisfied with the Z-height adjustment, make sure to set alpha back to 0 degrees.   Use the control panel joystick to move the beam over some carbon. Find focus using the Gatan computer Retract the screen Check the Gatan camera parameters. The exposure time should be 1x. The mode should be counted. Activate the Gatan camera. View Using the FFT window, find focus. Use the defocus knob on the control panel and adjust until no Thon rings are apparent. Reset the defocus to 0 using the control panel. Deactivate the Gatan camera. Stop View    Part 3 - Initialize Direct Alignments  Insert the screen. Activate the direct aligments menu (bottom right).

Use the control panel to dial in approximately -0.9 um defocus (note: this may vary depending on the magnification being used) Check and/or set the following parameters: Type: EF-CCD Exposure time [s]: 2.0 Binning: 2 Readout area: Full Electron counting: checked Autofocus to [um]: -0.9, checked Measure the objective stigmation. Measure Correct the objective stigmation. Correct  Part 5 - Focus Determination  Activate the Gatan camera. View Determine the correction from Sherpa (the defocus used is in the Sherpa window; the set defocus is listed in the current optics parameters on the microscope computer) Adjust the current defocus by the amount calculated above. This should get you very close to focus. Check for focus using the FFT window. It should be quite good. Make fine adjustments if needed using the defocus knob on control panel. If the defocus setting at focus is more than 0.2 microns from what is expected, Stop View and return to Part 3 - Initialize Direct Alignments for another try. Reset the defocus to 0 using the control panel. Deactivate the Gatan camera. Stop View.  Part 6 - Final Astigmatism Correction and ComaFree Alignment  Open the Sherpa window Use the control panel to dial in approximately -0.9 um defocus (note: this may vary depending on the magnification being used) Measure the objective stigmation. Measure Correct the objective stigmation. Correct Correct the coma. Correct Measure the objective stigmation. Measure. Correct if needed. Cycle between the objective stigmation and coma-free alignment until both are accurate and the errors are small. The last step should be measurement of the objective stigmation with the astigmatism measuring 1 nm or less.  Part 7 - Import Settings to EPU - CRITICAL!  Set the Data Acquisition optics parameters.

Here we show that binding of POU2F3 to the uncharacterized proteins C11orf53 and COLCA2 (renamed here OCA-T1/POU2AF2 and OCA-T2/POU2AF3, respectively) is critical in the tuft cell lineage. OCA-T1 and OCA-T2 are paralogues of the B-cell-specific coactivator OCA-B; all three proteins are encoded in a gene cluster and contain a conserved peptide that binds to class II POU transcription factors and a DNA octamer motif in a bivalent manner. We demonstrate that binding between POU2F3 and OCA-T1 or OCA-T2 is essential in tuft-cell-like small-cell lung cancer. Moreover, we generated OCA-T1-deficient mice, which are viable but lack tuft cells in several mucosal tissues.

These studies typically employ proteolytic treatment of biological samples to generate suitably sized peptides for tandem mass spectrometric (MS) analysis. In MS, fragmentation of peptides is largely driven by charge localization. Consequently, peptides with basic centers exclusively on their N-termini produce mainly b-ions. Thus, it was long ago realized that proteases that yield such peptides would be valuable proteomic tools for achieving simplified peptide fragmentation patterns and peptide assignment. Work by several groups has identified such proteases, however, structural analysis of these suggested that enzymatic optimization was possible. We therefore endeavored to find enzymes that could provide enhanced activity and versatility while maintaining specificity.

It is advisable to re-acquire this image before moving on. When satisfied, click Proceeed.   Step 2 - Generate the Atlas  Select Atlas  Session Setup. Enter a path for the data (the folder will be created automatically). Images should be saved as MRC format. Begin the atlas acquisition.   Step 3 - Set up the EPU Session  Select EPU  Session Setup. Enter the setup parameters. Enter a path for the data (the folder will be created automatically). Images should be saved as Unnormalized Packed and MRC format. Make sure that the acqusition type is Manual. Make sure to select the correct grid type and indicate the hole paramters (if applicable). Still in the EPU window, use the Atlas tab to select a grid square. Determine the eucentric height. Select Preparation  Hole/Eucentric Height  Auto Eucentric Height by beam tilt. It can be useful to take an image of an empty hole in the grid for subsequent determination of approximate ice thickness. This can be done by centering on the empty hole, then selecting Preparation  Data Acquisition  Acquire. Note the dose (lower right window). Check the grid square quality. Move to a hole that could be potenially useful for collection. Then collect an image Preparation  Data Acquisition  Acquire. If the ice thickness is appropriate (usually ~80% of the empty hole dose is desireable), this square can be used for data collection. EPU  Atlas  (Right Click on Grid Square) Add Square. Generate the pattern of images to be collected. EPU  Hole Selection  Generate Pattern. Use the brush too to manually remove i) empty holes/regions, ii) significant contamination, iii) thick ice near the edges of each grid square. Some of this can be automated using the controls in the top and right panels. Add the collection and focus parameters. Defocus values that are typically used begin around -3.2 microns and continue to -1.4 microns. To add these, enter the desired defocus value and click on the 📄 icon next to the entry field. It should now be present in the defocus values list above. Valeus can be removed by selecting them and clicking on the 🗑️ icon. Be sure to double check these and ensure that the values are negative! Set the following parameters for Lacey carbon grids:  Spacing = 1 um Autofocus Recurrance = 5 um Delay after Stage Shift = 11 seconds   Alternatively, set the following parameters for Quantifoil grids:  Maximum Image Shift = 9 um Delay after Image Shift = 1.5 seconds Delay after Stage Shift = 2 seconds  \tIf collecting from Quantifoil grids, beam shift collection can dramatically speed up acquisiton. Use the EPU  Generate Template to set this up. Be sure to include one shot for Autofocus. If you are unsure how to make an appropriate template, ask the Facility Manager. Return to the EPU  Atlas view. The grid square should now display the eucentric height determined earlier and the number of images to be collected should be indicated in the right-most panel. Repeat this process beginning at item 3. It is not necessary to re-enter the collection (item 9) as these should be preserved from earlier. Continue adding more grid squares until there are enough for the desired collection time.   Step 4 - Perform Direct Alignments Part 1 - Grid Square Selection Note: As with the Image Shift Calibration, this square will take a fair amount of radiation damage, so it is important that it is not a square that you plan to use for data acqusition. A square that has a few empty holes and some interestingly-shaped contamination is ideal.  Use EPU to navigate to a new grid square. Move to an empty hole for best contrast. Determine the eucentric height. Auto functions  Hole Eucentric  Eucentric Height by Beam Tilt Position the beam on the edge of an empty hole. This can be done using the EPU controls or by using the joystick on the control panel if the screen is inserted.  Part 2 - Initial Focus Determination Overview: This part of the protocol will serve to tune the eucentric height and find focus. It will be refined in Part 5.\n Insert the screen Set the eucentric height manually Set the microscope optics to the Data Acquisition setting. Preparation  Data Acquisition  SET Use the control panel joystick to move to an area where you can see the edge of the hole and some carbon. Set the alpha angle to +/- 20 degrees. The stage should rotate. The goal is to adjust the Z-height of the stage such that changing alpha +/- 20 degrees keeps the center of the image in place. Z-height can be adjusted using the control panel (rightmost buttons). When adjusting the height, it is likely necessary to toggle between alpha=0 and alpha=20. When satisfied with the Z-height adjustment, make sure to set alpha back to 0 degrees.   Use the control panel joystick to move the beam over some carbon. Find focus using the Gatan computer Retract the screen Activate the Gatan camera. View Using the FFT window, find focus. Use the defocus knob on the control panel and adjust until no Thon rings are apparent. Reset the defocus to 0 using the control panel. Deactivate the Gatan camera. Stop View    Part 3 - Initialize Direct Alignments  Insert the screen. Activate the direct aligments menu (bottom right). Sequentially adjust the alignments: nP beam tilt ppX (use multifunction X to minimize movement) nP beam tilt ppY (use multifunction X to minimize movement) beamshift center (use both knobs; center on the green circle) rotation center (minimize movement; use both knobs)   Click Done when finished. Retract the screen.  Part 4 - Initial Astigmatism Correction and Coma-Free Alignment  Open the Sherpa window. If Sherpa is not already running, it can be launched from Microscope Software Launcher  Tools  Sherpa. Use the control panel to dial in approximately -1.1 um defocus (note: this may vary depending on the magnification being used) Check and/or set the following parameters: Type: EF-CCD Exposure time [s]: 3.0 Binning: 2 Readout area: Full Electron counting: checked Autofocus to [um]: -1.0, checked Measure the objective stigmation. Measure Correct the objective stigmation. Correct  Part 5 - Focus Determination  Activate the Gatan camera. View Determine the correction from Sherpa (the defocus used is in the Sherpa window; the set defocus is listed in the current optics parameters on the microscope computer) Adjust the current defocus by the amount calculated above. This should get you very close to focus. Check for focus using the FFT window. It should be quite good. Make fine adjustments if needed using the defocus knob on control panel. Reset the defocus to 0 using the control panel Deactivate the Gatan camera. Stop View  Part 6 - Final Astigmatism Correction and ComaFree Alignment  Open the Sherpa window Use the control panel to dial in approximately -1.1 um defocus (note: this may vary depending on the magnification being used) Measure the objective stigmation. Measure Correct the objective stigmation. Correct Correct the coma. Correct Measure the objective stigmation. Measure. Correct if needed. Cycle between the objective stigmation and coma-free alignment until both are accurate and the errors are small. The last step should be measurement of the objective stigmation with the astigmatism measuring 1 nm or less.  Part VII - Import Settings to EPU - CRITICAL!

Course materials can be found in the downloads. An outline of the course contents is also provided.\n  Tutorial Downloads  Tutorial Documentation - MS Word Practice Questions - MS Word Practice Question - PyMOL Session (Finished) Quiz - MS Word    Workshop Notes What PyMOL does and does not do:  PyMOL is a molecular graphics program that is primarily designed for producing publication-quality illustrations and animations. In its purest form, PyMOL is NOT used for molecular modeling, structure manipulation, or in silico experiments. PyMOL is user-sponsored but runs on an open source platform.  About the PDB file format  The main file format you will use with PyMOL has the extension .pdb (Protein Data Bank). PDB files are plain text documents and have a straightforward and consistent structure. The spacing of entries is critical to the file being read properly.   Line IdentifierDescription TitleName of the entry RemarksDescriptors for everything used in the project. This includes biological, chemical, physical, crystallographic, refinement, and processing parameters. CRYS1 cardUnit cell dimensions for the crystal Origin and Scale CardsSets the coordinate system ATOM entriesCoordinates (see below) ANISOU entriesOptional anisotropic temperature factor line Terminators (TER, END)Indicates the end of chains or the end of the file   The bare minimum .pdb file has a CRYS1 card and atom entries. Each ATOM entry has several parameters (in order):  atom card atom number atom identity amino acid identity chain identity amino acid number x, y, z, coordinates occupancy (0.00-1.00) temperature factor (B-factor) atomic element    The PyMOL Interface  Both GUI and command line driven Has two GUIs (External and Internal):  The external GUI is used for rendering images, creating animations, and controlling many of PyMOL’s settings. The internal GUI is used for controlling exactly what objects and elements are displayed, how they are colored, and how they are positioned. Think of PyMOL as a photo shoot. The internal GUI controls what your model is wearing and how the subject is positioned. The external GUI controls the settings on your camera.    Opening Files  Option 1: Go to www.pdb.org and find the PDB file you would like. Download the coordinates. Then use File  Open to browse and open the file. Option 2: Use the command line. Simply type fetch followed by the PDB code.   fetch 3SU3 Internal GUI Controls:  Change molecular orientation (mouse controls)  Mouse ButtonLeftMiddleRightWheel DragRotationMoveZoomSlab ClickPick AtomCenterMenu  Note: These are also indicated in the lower-right corner of the internal GUI window.  Changing the appearance of molecules or selections - There are 5 main buttons next to each element:\n AActions SShow (display the selection in a certain way, i.e. 'cartoon', 'surface', etc.) HHide (hide certain selection features that are currently displayed) LLabel CColor   Selecting molecules, chains, atoms, or regions can be accomplished either through the command line or by pointing and clicking. Here are the three most useful ways I like: Click on the residue of interest. You will see that a (sele) object has been created in the internal GUI. You can rename this object and PyMOL will remember the selection in the future. The selection can be edited later as well. Use the external GUI can click Display  Sequence On. This will show you the amino acid sequence of the structure. You can select residues by clicking on them. Use the select command line command. This command is very powerful, but may take some time to get the hang of.   #This will select chain A and name it “mychain” select mychain, chain A #This will select all c, o, n, and alpha-carbon atoms and name the selection “certainatoms” select certainatoms, name c+o+n+ca\t#This will select everything that is both in a selection named “file1” and annotated as chain B. Note that there is no comma in this command. select file1 and chain B #This will select everything that is both in a selection named “file1” and annotated as chain B and then name the selection “file1chainB” select file1chainB, file1 and chain B Distances and angles can be measured using the measurement wizard. The wizard can be found under Wizard  Measurement. To measure distances, you will simply need to click each atom. After clicking the second atom, a dashed line and distance (in Angstroms) will appear. To measure angles, you will need to first change the measurement mode from Distances to Angles in the lower right corner of the internal GUI. Then click on three atoms. The angle will be displayed.   Other useful display features: Electrostatics can be generated using the Action button for an object. Simply click Action  generate  vacuum electrostatics. Note that these are rather quick-and-dirty (i.e. not publishable) but can give a nice approximation of the electrostatic surface. For a publishable electrostatic surface, plug-ins are required such as APBS. Symmetry-related molecules can also be generated using the Action button. This is particularly useful if a molecule adopts a symmetric structure that is coincident with a crystallographic axis. Click Action  generate  symmetry mates and select a distance (5 Å is usually good enough). You can then hide the molecules that you are not interested in (or delete them altogether)   Alignment One of the most useful features that PyMOL boasts is a native three-dimensional alignment algorithm. Alignment of two objects can be performed simply using the align -or- super command line commands. Note that alignments can be performed between entire structure depositions, specific chains, or even selected residues. Define your selection (described above), name them, and use the align command to superpose one molecule onto the other.    #This command attempts to move the entire PDB coordinates of PDB1 onto PDB2. This would work well for two homologous structures with one copy in the asymmetric unit align PDB1, PDB2 #Alternatively, the super command can be used. The results may be slightly different. super PDB1, PDB2 #This command moves the molecule that selection1 “belongs” to onto the molecule that selection2 “belongs” to using only selection1 and selection2 to calculate the alignment. This is useful (for example) if you have two distantly-related proteins with conserved active sites. You could select the active site residues of each, name them, and then align the molecules based only on the important residues.align PDB1, PDB2 align my_selection1, my_selection2\tExternal GUI Controls:  Changing the background, general appearance, and rendering options can be accomplished using the eternal GUI Setting menu. These are pretty straightforward. Ray tracing will provide you with high resolution images. There are two options to initiate a ray trace: you can use the external GUI or the command line. If using the external GUI, click the Ray button at the top right corner of the GUI. The command line can also be used. The command line affords more flexibility in outputting an image of defined size.    #Ray traces the current view at 2400 x 3600 pixels ray 2400,3600 Saving images can be accomplished at any time by using the selecting File  Save Image As in the external GUI. Alternatively, the command line can be used as below.  #Save the current view as MyImage.png png MyImage.png Saving your PyMOL session can also be accomplished at any time by selecting File  Save Session As. This is very useful as it will allow you to edit your work in the future.  Other things to note:  PyMOL has a very powerful scripting language. Everything that can be done with the GUI can be done by the command line (and more!). Scripting allows you to either save your commands as you execute them or just write code from scratch. This is invaluable when the same actions need to be performed repetitively or when something very minor changes in your coordinate. There are many other graphics programs, but PyMOL seems to be the most popular. Other programs that you may hear about include RasMOL, Raster3D, MolScript, Chimera, etc. With cryoEM data becoming more and more prevalent, Chimera is especially becoming a more popular tool in the field.

Grids - As many as you intend to freeze, plus a couple extra in case of mishaps Sample - At working concentration, spun/filtered to remove aggregates Small transfer dewar for the Vitrobot \u0026 Leica A single liquid nitrogen transfer dewar filled with nitrogen  Prepare the Leica apparatus  Using a 60 mL syringe connected to the luer lock valve on the right of the instrument, fill the humidifier chamber with 90 mL of deionized water. Place the following components in the indicated locations within the plunging chamber:  Cryogen holder for liquid ethane - 12 o'clock Grid box reservoir - 4 o'clock - Make sure this is seated properly in place. First grid box - in grid box reservior; make sure this is properly seated. Additional grid boxes - 6-9 o'clock Cryogen holder lid (with tubing connected to the liquid ethane tank below the Leica) - 10 o'clock   Make sure that the grid box screws are loosened and that the grid box holder cover is oriented to allow access to the first slot. Fill the nitrogen reservoir (the main part of the chamber). Nitrogen will seep down through the grating into a larger reservoir. The reservoir fill and temperature can be monitored on the Leica display. The goal is to begin with the reservoir full (100%) at a temperature of -180\u0026deg;C. Allow the reservoir to equilibrate. If comforatable, this a good time to glow discharge grids. Top off the reservoir such that the nitrogen level is just at the level of the grating. Fill the grid box reservoir with nitrogen. Fill the cryogen reservoir with ethane. Move the cryogen holder lid to cover the cryogen holder Make sure to wear eye protection. Gently open the outlet valve on the liquid ethane tank.\nNote: The main tank valve should already be open and the regulator should be already properly adjusted. In most cases, simply open the black outlet valve. When the cryogen holder is full, close the outlet valve and carefully remove the cryogen holder cover.   The Leica apparatus is now ready for use.  Glow discharge grids  Check the status of the glow discharge device oil supply. If more than 1-2 months old, ask for help changing it. Carefully place grids on a clean glass coverslip, carbon side up. Turn on the glow discharge apparatus. Remove the bell jar cover from the apparatus. Carefully insert the coverslip with grids onto the discharge platform. Replace the bell jar cover. Activate the glow discharge chamber. When the glow discharge protocol has completed, remove the bell jar cover. Carefully remove the coverslip with grids to the desired work surface. Replace the bell jar cover for long-term storage. Turn off the glow discharge device.  Load grids onto the Leica forceps  Four sets of forceps are ideal as this will let you load an entire grid box at once. For left-handed loading (our current setup), load grids carbon side up onto the Leica forceps. For right-handed loading, load grids carbon side down.  Apply samples and plunge freeze  If this is the first sample or the blotting paper is spent, install a fresh piece of blotting paper. It is held in place by a thin, magnetic ring. Install one set of the grid-loaded Leica forceps on the loading piston. Initialize the loading protocol either with the touch screen or foot pedal. The humidified chamber should lower into place. Using the side-entry port, apply 4 uL of sample to the grid with a pipet. Advance the protocol with the foot pedal. The pre-blotting countdown will begin, after which the blotting and plunging will automatically proceed. After plunging, the chamber should raise. Advance the protocol once more with the foot pedal. The piston should raise slightly, but the grid should remain submerged in the cryogen. Carefully, while maintaining the grid in the liquid ethane, disconnect the forceps from the piston. Tightly grip the forceps, and release the black clip.\nPro tip: It is much easier to slide the black clip up of the forceps are gripped from above. However, be careful not to release the forceps or the grid will be dropped! I prefer to do the following: Grip the forceps tightly, slightly above the black clip. While still maintaining pressure, move the black clip upward slightly, just until it is no longer clipped. While still maintaining pressure, use your other hand to grip the forceps tightly slightly below the black clip. With the first hand, slide the black clip to the top of the forceps. The forceps are now ready for transferring the grid to the grid box.    In one deft motion, move the grid from the cryogen holder to the nitrogen in the grid box reservoir. Transfer the grid to the grid box. Advance the grid box cover one slot, such that a space is accessible for the next grid. Continue applying samples, plunging, and transferring until the grid box is full. Rotate the grid box cover such that all slots are fully covered. Tighten the grid box cover with a screw driver. With forceps, transfer the grid box to the small Leica/Vitrobot transport dewar. If freezing additional boxes of grids add additional liquid nitrogen to the grid box reservoir. It is easier if this is done while covering the ethane/cryogen reservoir with its lid, just be sure to remove the lid before continuing. Continue as above for all samples. When finished, store the grid boxes in a long-term liquid nitrogen storage dewar.  Clean up  Once all samples have been stored, clean up the area and move all tools to the drying oven. Carefully drain the humidifier by opening the valve on the filling tubing. Allow the humidifier to empty completely. You may speed this up with the syringe if desired. Open the humidifier chamber door. Remove and discard the spent blotting paper. Very carefully, remove the the cryogen container. Place it in a safe area for evaporation of the liquid ethane. Begin the bake-out protocol. Ensure that the humidifier chamber door is open during this time. The bake-out timer will begin counting down once the nitrogen reservoir level has reached zero.   Part II - Grid Clipping Fill two liquid nitrogen transfer dewars. Make sure these are dry before beginning. Assemble the necessary tools   Large forceps Flat-T autoloader forceps C-clip holder wands (one per grid) Rings and C-clips (one per grid; not pictured) Screwdriver Table-top cryo dewar (and cover) for grid clipping Aluminum \u0026 brass specimen transfer pedestal (not pictured) Cryo-EM grid box(es) (not pictured) Cryo-EM grid box top fastener wand(s) Funnel (not pictured)   Load C-clips into the holder wands.  Use forceps and firm pressure to insert a single C-clip into the wand. Make sure that the C-clip is hugging the inside wall of the wand. Use forceps to adjust if necessary. Hold the wand vertically and position it on a flat surface such that the tip of the wand is held firmly against the surface. Press down on the wand trigger to engage and align the C-clip at the tip of the wand. Inspect proper placement of the C-clip  Prepare the transfer station   Arrange the transfer setup as pictured. It should include the specimen transfer pedestal, loaded C-clip wands, and autoloader forceps. Additionally, place clip rings (flat-side down) in each of the four mounting positions in the brass portion of the transfer pedestal. Inspect each clip ring to make sure that the clip side is face-up. Once clip rings are in place, rotate the brass disc such that all clips are covered. This will ensure they do not move while cooling the station. Place cryo-EM grid box(es) on the sample pedestal. Open them using the grid box fastener wand. Keep the grid box top attached to the fastner wand until needed.  Recover frozen samples from the storage dewar. Place them in a styrofoam carrier filled with liquid nitrogen. Cool the transfer station  Temporarily remove the wands and forceps from the transfer station. Place them away from the transfer station to ensure they do not cool (and consequently get condensation on them) while cooling the transfer station (next step). Apply the plastic cover to the transfer station. Use the large funnel to fill the chamber with liquid nitrogen until the nitrogen level just covers the aluminum portion of the transfer pedestal. Note: Do not cover the brass portion of the pedestal. If the brass portion does get covered, evaporate the addtional nitrogen by submerging the end of any metal tool into the areas with excess nitrogen. It should boil off fairly quickly.  Clip and transfer grids Note: Replace the wands and forceps in the transfer station and allow them to eqilibrate. While clipping and transferring, keep all tools below the nitrogen level to avoid ice contamination.\n Transfer the grid storage box to one well in the specimen transfer pedestal. Loosen the top of the grid storage box with a screwdriver Make sure that the brass portion of the sample transfer pedestal is aligned such that a clip is accessible in the grid-loading positon. With pointed forceps, transfer a single grid to the clip. Ensure that the grid is centered. Using the blunt end of a pair of forceps, rotate the brass portion of the transfer pedestal one notch such that the clip and grid are now in the clipping position. Insert a loaded C-clip holder wand into the same, transfer pedestal hole. Ensure that the wand is at the bottom of the hole, then install the C-clip by ejecting it by pressing on the back end of the C-clip holder wand. Return the pedestal to the grid-loading positon. CRITICAL: Inspect the grid to ensure that the clipping was successful.\nAn improperly-clipped grid can come loose in the microscope and necessitates disassembly of the scope. You do not want this to happen! Continue as above until all grids have been transferred. Fasten the cryo-EM grid box cover using the fastener wand. Transfer the loaded cryo-EM grid box to filled stryofoam dewar. If any grids remain in the original grid storage box, ensure that the cover is properly oriented, then fasten it with the screwdriver. These grids can be taken back to the storage dewar.   II. Autoloader Cartridge Loading Prepare the autoloader cassette transfer station   Assemble the autoloader transfer station as pictured. Make sure that the exit hatch cover is in place. Make sure to include the cassette ejector wand and cassette (the cassette should be oriented with \"1\" toward the front) Ensure that the cassette is empty and that the orientaiton is correct. Holder slots should look like the letter \"L\". Make sure the foam and central plastic covers are in place. Fill the transfer station until the liquid nitrogen level has just covered the cassette. A bit extra (1/4\") can be added additionally. Additionally, fill the autoloader transfer canister with liquid nitrogen. Ensure that the pin at the top of the canister is mobile by gently pulling up on it. Once the canister's temperature has equilibrated, cover it.  Transfer the clipped grids to the autoloader cassette  Using the cryo-EM box top fastener wand, transfer each cryo-EM grid box to the autoloader cassette transfer station. Unscrew the cryo-EM grid box lids and remove them. CRITICAL: Do not fully load a cassette! If there is already a grid on the scope, you will be stuck! Typically, we will leave the first position empty. Using the Flat-T autoloader forceps, transfer each clipped grid to the autoloader cassette. Each clipped grid should be placed such that is is held in place, just above the bottom of each \"L\". It should look like L---\u0026#8515; from above. Continue loading all of the clipped grids into the autoloader cassette. Once all grids have been loaded, ensure that the autoloader transfer canister (NanoCab) is cool. Remove the exit hatch cover and install the autoloader transfer canister. Use the cassette holder to grab the autoloader cassette and quickly move it to the canister via the exit hatch. Remove the canister from the transfer station. Ensure that the cassette is properly seated (it should be below the surface of the nitrogen and the pin a the top of the canister should extend.)  Load the cassette into the microscope  Ensure that there is not currently a cassette in the microscope. Open the front access panel to the Titan Krios. Install the NanoCab canister, curve side first, in the loading position. The green light should activate. Press the green button. Wait for the cassette to be loaded. When the protocol completes, the cassette should be visible through the viewing window and the white button should turn off. Remove the NanoCab canister, discard the remaining nitrogen, and place the canister in the drying oven.  Clean up  Return to the autoloader cassette transfer station. Carefully remove all of the components, discard the remaining nitrogen, and place all tools and the transfer station itself in the drying oven. Inspect the rest of the work area. Discard any additional trash and return all tools and supplies to their rightful storage locations.

A few important notes:\n Scope alignment and maintenance are not included. This protocol assumes a well-aligned microscope. Staining protocols have not yet been included. Advanced settings for collecting data with minimal dosage are not yet included.  Initial Setup  Before beginning, make sure that the column valve is closed. Set up the cold trap.\nNote: The dewar should be checked every 1-2 hours and refilled as needed. Fill the small nitrogen dewar. Install the dewar and insert the copper bundle. Be careful to avoid too much splashing. Cover the dewar with its foam cap.  Turn on the filament. This takes ~10 minutes to warm up. Setup  Filament. Turn on the Turbo pump. Wait until this finishes to proceed. Setup  Turbo. Make sure the cryobox (decontaminatior) is inserted. Vacuum  [popout]  Cryobox.  Sample Insertion  Make sure the column valves are closed. Remove the sample holder wand. Pull the wand out until it stops. Rotate the wand clockwise so that the pin (originally at 12 o'clock) is at 5 o'clock. Pull the wand out fully and place it in the holding station.   Recover any currently-loaded grid and place the new grid in the holder. Insert the sample holder wand Insert the wand such that the pin is approximately at 2 o'clock. Rotate the wand clockwise smartly until it is at the 5 o'clock position. Immediately push the wand in approximately 1/4 inch until it stops. Wait for the air lock protocol to complete (this is automatic, check the Setup  Vacuum menu for the countdown). Rotate the wand such that the pin will be at the 12 o'clock positon. Allow the vacuum to pull the wand into the instrument. Provide gentle resistance to control the rate of insertion. Tap Tap (for good luck 🍀)   Wait until the vacuum has recovered. This should only take a couple of moments. Confirm the specimen holder type (Single Tilt).  Sample Screening  Open the column valve. Setup  (Col. Valve Closed).\nNote: The Turbo will automatically turn off when you open the column valve. Make sure that the user interface is set to Search mode. Low Dose  Search. Make sure that the screen is inserted. Flucam Viewer Window  Insert Screen. Use the control panel joystick to inspect the grid while at low magnification (~500x). The beam spread and position can be adjusted using the Intensity and Track Ball controls on the control panel, respectively. Use the control panel interface to set the Magnification to SA 2600x. Set the eucentric height. Check the eucentric height by alternating the tilt angle (alpha) from 0 to 20 degrees. Search  [popout menu]  Set Alpha. Adjust as needed using the Z-axis adjustment buttons on the control panel. The goal is for the center of the viewfinder to remain on the same spot when alternating between the tilt angles.  Zoom in as needed (Magnification on the control panel) and inspect for good regions of the grid. Find focus by using the TEM Imaging and Analysis window. Low Dose  Focus. Retract the screen (Flucam Viewer Window  (Insert Screen)). Activate the CCD/TV Camera. Low Dose  CCD/TV Camera  [popout]  Mode  Continuous. Turn on the FFT window. FFT/IFFT  FFT. Find focus using the Focus knob until the presence of zeros in the FFT is at a minimum. Reset the defocus using the control panel shortcut (usually R2). Adjust to ~1 um defocus (-1.00 um) using the Focus knob. Change the CCD Mode to Single. Low Dose  CCD/TV Camera  [popout]  Mode  Single. Save the image by right-clicking and specifying the file name/path  Low dosage tab default settings:  Mode\tZoom\tSpot Size\tIntensity\tOther Search\t2600x\t6\t80\tx: 0.0 um; y: 0.0 um Focus\t150000x\t6\t40\t1.6 um; 90\u0026deg; Exposure\t150000x\t6\t40\t1.0 seconds   Continue this process around the grid. Eucentric height should be re-determined for each grid square, but only defocus needs to be re-determined for spots within a grid square. When finished with a grid, reset all settings. Reset the magnification. Low Dose  Search. Reset the holder position. Search  Reset Holder. Remove the screen. Flucam Viewer  (Insert Screen). Close the column valve. Setup  Col. Valve Closed. If more grids are to be screened, activate the Turbo pump. Setup  Turbo pump.  Repeat the Sample Insertion and Sample Screening steps for each grid.  Shutdown  Make sure the column valves are closed, the grid holder position is reset, and that the screen is out. If desired, remove the current grid using the Sample Insertion protocol above. Replace the sample holder wand once the Turbo pump vaccum is restored. Turn off the Filament. Setup  Filament Turn off the Turbo pump. Setup  Turbo Remove the nitrogen dewar. Start the cryocycle. Cryo  Vacuum  [popout]  Cryo  Cryocycle.\nNote: This will start the Turbo pump. Some vacuum may be lost. This is ok.

PiRNAs are highly variable in sequence with extensive targeting potential. Their diversity is restricted by their preference to start with a Uridine (U) at the 5' most position (1U-bias), a bias that remains poorly understood. Here we uncover that the 1U-bias of Piwi-piRNAs is established by consecutive discrimination against all nucleotides but U, first during piRNA biogenesis and then upon interaction with Piwi's specificity loop. Sequence preferences during piRNA processing also restrict U across the piRNA body with the potential to directly impact target recognition. Overall, the uncovered signatures could modulate specificity and efficacy of piRNA-mediated transposon restriction, and provide a substrate for purifying selection in the ongoing arms race between genomes and their mobile parasites.","tags":["Animals","Animals","Genetically Modified","Argonaute Proteins","Drosophila","Drosophila Proteins","Female","Mutation","Ovary","Protein Domains","RNA","Small Interfering","Uracil","Uridine"],"title":"Decoding the 5' nucleotide bias of PIWI-interacting RNAs","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Welcome to Slides Academic\n Features  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides   Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export: E   Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026#34;blueberry\u0026#34; if porridge == \u0026#34;blueberry\u0026#34;:  print(\u0026#34;Eating...\u0026#34;)  Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = ;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\n Fragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}} Press Space to play!\nOne  **Two**  Three   A fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears   Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}} Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view    Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links    night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links   Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026#34;/img/boards.jpg\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026#34;#0000FF\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026#34;my-style\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}}  Custom CSS Example Let\u0026rsquo;s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 {  color: navy; }  Questions?

Unfortunately, for many therapeutic targets such alleles are not available. To address this issue, we evaluated whether CRISPR-Cas9-mediated insertion/deletion (indel) mutagenesis can produce drug-resistance alleles at endogenous loci. This method takes advantage of the heterogeneous in-frame alleles produced following Cas9-mediated DNA cleavage, which we show can generate rare alleles that confer resistance to the growth-arrest caused by chemical inhibitors. We used this approach to identify novel resistance alleles of two lysine methyltransferases, DOT1L and EZH2, which are each essential for the growth of MLL-fusion leukemia cells. We biochemically characterized the DOT1L mutation, showing that it is significantly more active than the wild-type enzyme. These findings validate the on-target anti-leukemia activities of existing DOT1L and EZH2 inhibitors and reveal a simple method for deriving drug-resistance alleles for novel targets, which may have utility during early stages of drug development.","tags":["Alleles","Animals","Antineoplastic Agents","Benzimidazoles","Cell Line","Cell Line","Tumor","Cell Proliferation","Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats","CRISPR-Cas Systems","Drug Resistance","Neoplasm","Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 Protein","HEK293 Cells","Humans","INDEL Mutation","Methyltransferases","Mice","Models","Molecular","Mutagenesis","Neoplasms"],"title":"Rapid generation of drug-resistance alleles at endogenous loci using CRISPR-Cas9 indel mutagenesis","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1461715200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461715200,"objectID":"d1311ddf745551c9e117aa4bb7e28516","permalink":"https://jonipsaro.github.io/project/external-project/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/external-project/","section":"project","summary":"An example of linking directly to an external project website using `external_link`.","tags":["Demo"],"title":"External Project","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

Here, we demonstrate that the AML maintenance function of BRD4 requires its interaction with NSD3, which belongs to a subfamily of H3K36 methyltransferases. Unexpectedly, AML cells were found to only require a short isoform of NSD3 that lacks the methyltransferase domain. We show that NSD3-short is an adaptor protein that sustains leukemia by linking BRD4 to the CHD8 chromatin remodeler, by using a PWWP chromatin reader module, and by employing an acidic transactivation domain. Genetic targeting of NSD3 or CHD8 mimics the phenotypic and transcriptional effects of BRD4 inhibition. Furthermore, BRD4, NSD3, and CHD8 colocalize across the AML genome, and each is released from super-enhancer regions upon chemical inhibition of BET bromodomains. These findings suggest that BET inhibitors exert therapeutic effects in leukemia by evicting BRD4-NSD3-CHD8 complexes from chromatin to suppress transcription.","tags":["Animals","Catalytic Domain","Cell Proliferation","Chromatin Assembly and Disassembly","DNA-Binding Proteins","Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase","HL-60 Cells","Humans","Leukemia","Myeloid","Acute","Mice","Nuclear Proteins","Promoter Regions","Genetic","Protein Isoforms","Transcription Factors"],"title":"NSD3-Short Is an Adaptor Protein that Couples BRD4 to the CHD8 Chromatin Remodeler","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**Jonathan J.

Primary piRNAs come from discrete genomic loci, termed piRNA clusters, and seem to be derived from long, single-stranded precursors. The biogenesis of primary piRNAs involves at least two nucleolytic steps. An unknown enzyme cleaves piRNA cluster transcripts to generate monophosphorylated piRNA 5' ends. piRNA 3' ends are probably formed by exonucleolytic trimming, after a piRNA precursor is loaded into its PIWI partner. Secondary piRNAs arise during the adaptive 'ping-pong' cycle, with their 5' termini being formed by the activity of PIWIs themselves. A number of proteins have been implicated genetically in primary piRNA biogenesis. One of these, Drosophila melanogaster Zucchini, is a member of the phospholipase-D family of phosphodiesterases, which includes both phospholipases and nucleases. Here we produced a dimeric, soluble fragment of the mouse Zucchini homologue (mZuc; also known as PLD6) and show that it possesses single-strand-specific nuclease activity. A crystal structure of mZuc at 1.75 Å resolution indicates greater architectural similarity to phospholipase-D family nucleases than to phospholipases. Together, our data suggest that the Zucchini proteins act in primary piRNA biogenesis as nucleases, perhaps generating the 5' ends of primary piRNAs.","tags":["Animals","Biocatalysis","Catalytic Domain","Crystallography","X-Ray","Drosophila Proteins","Endoribonucleases","Mice","Mitochondrial Proteins","Models","Molecular","Phospholipase D","Protein Conformation","Protein Multimerization","RNA","Small Interfering","Static Electricity","Substrate Specificity"],"title":"The structural biochemistry of Zucchini implicates it as a nuclease in piRNA biogenesis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mai Yasunaga","**Jonathan J.

Maintaining such organization and preserving membrane integrity under different conditions are accomplished through intracellular tethering to an extensive, flexible protein network. Spectrin, the principal component of this network, is attached to the membrane through the adaptor protein ankyrin, which directly bridges the interaction between β-spectrin and membrane proteins. Ankyrins have a modular structure that includes two tandem ZU5 domains. The first domain, ZU5A, is directly responsible for binding β-spectrin. Here, we present a structure of the tandem ZU5 repeats of human erythrocyte ankyrin. Structural and biophysical experiments show that the second ZU5 domain, ZU5B, does not participate in spectrin binding. ZU5B is structurally similar to the ZU5 domain found in the netrin receptor UNC5b supramodule, suggesting that it could interact with other domains in ankyrin. Comparison of several ZU5 domains demonstrates that the ZU5 domain represents a compact and versatile protein interaction module.","tags":["Amino Acid Sequence","Ankyrins","Crystallography","X-Ray","Erythrocytes","Humans","Molecular Sequence Data","Protein Binding","Protein Interaction Domains and Motifs","Protein Structure","Tertiary","Spectrin"],"title":"Structurally similar but functionally diverse ZU5 domains in human erythrocyte ankyrin","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Renee C.

Drawbacks include low signal sensitivity, fast clearance, and nonspecificity that limit efficacy in experimental imaging. In order to create a bioresponsive MR contrast agent, a series of four Gd(III) complexes targeted to the HaloTag reporter were designed and synthesized. HaloTag is unique among reporter proteins for its specificity, versatility, and the covalent interaction between substrate and protein. In similar systems, these properties produce prolonged in vivo lifetimes and extended imaging opportunities for contrast agents, longer rotational correlation times, and increases in relaxivity (r(1)) upon binding to the HaloTag protein. In this work we report a new MR contrast probe, 2CHTGd, which forms a covalent bond with its target protein and results in a dramatic increase in sensitivity. A 6-fold increase in r(1), from 3.8 to 22 mM(-1) s(-1), is observed upon 2CHTGd binding to the target protein. This probe was designed for use with the HaloTag protein system which allows for a variety of substrates (specific for MRI, florescence, or protein purification applications) to be used with the same reporter.","tags":["Contrast Media","Gadolinium","Luminescent Proteins","Magnetic Resonance Imaging","Molecular Structure","Organometallic Compounds","Stereoisomerism"],"title":"Reporter protein-targeted probes for magnetic resonance imaging","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**Jonathan J.

Although this network involves many interactions, the most common hemolytic anemia mutations that disrupt erythrocyte morphology affect the spectrin tetramerization domains. Although much is known clinically about the resulting conditions (hereditary elliptocytosis and pyropoikilocytosis), the detailed structural basis for spectrin tetramerization and its disruption by hereditary anemia mutations remains elusive. Thus, to provide further insights into spectrin assembly and tetramer site mutations, a crystal structure of the spectrin tetramerization domain complex has been determined. Architecturally, this complex shows striking resemblance to multirepeat spectrin fragments, with the interacting tetramer site region forming a central, composite repeat. This structure identifies conformational changes in alpha-spectrin that occur upon binding to beta-spectrin, and it reports the first structure of the beta-spectrin tetramerization domain. Analysis of the interaction surfaces indicates an extensive interface dominated by hydrophobic contacts and supplemented by electrostatic complementarity. Analysis of evolutionarily conserved residues suggests additional surfaces that may form important interactions. Finally, mapping of hereditary anemia-related mutations onto the structure demonstrate that most, but not all, local hereditary anemia mutations map to the interacting domains. The potential molecular effects of these mutations are described.","tags":["Crystallography","X-Ray","Elliptocytosis","Hereditary","Erythrocyte Membrane","Humans","Mutagenesis","Site-Directed","Mutation","Protein Binding","Protein Multimerization","Protein Structure","Quaternary","Protein Structure","Tertiary","Spectrin","Structure-Activity Relationship"],"title":"Crystal structure and functional interpretation of the erythrocyte spectrin tetramerization domain complex","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**Jonathan J.

In addition to validating the structural model, these data provide insight into the nature of some mutations associated with cell morphology defects, including those found in human diseases such as hereditary spherocytosis and elliptocytosis.

The structure of the spectrin binding domain of ankyrin and the ankyrin binding domain of spectrin have been solved to elucidate the structural basis for ankyrin-spectrin recognition. The structure of repeats 14 and 15 of spectrin shows that these repeats are similar to all other spectrin repeats. One feature that could account for the preference of ankyrin for these repeats is the presence of a conserved, negatively charged patch on one side of repeat 14. The structure of the ankyrin ZU5 domain shows a novel structure containing a beta core. The structure reveals that the canonical ZU5 consensus sequence is likely to be missing an important region that codes for a beta strand that forms part of the core of the domain. In addition, a positively charged region is suggestive of a binding surface for the negatively charged spectrin repeat 14. Previously reported mutants of ankyrin that map to this region lie mostly on the surface of the protein, although at least one is likely to be part of the core.","tags":["Amino Acid Sequence","Ankyrins","Binding Sites","Crystallography","X-Ray","Humans","Models","Biological","Models","Molecular","Molecular Conformation","Molecular Sequence Data","Protein Interaction Domains and Motifs","Protein Interaction Mapping","Sequence Homology","Amino Acid","Spectrin"],"title":"Structures of the spectrin-ankyrin interaction binding domains","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**Jonathan J.

Conflicting evidence, however, had identified two different, non-overlapping human erythroid ankyrin subdomains, Zu5 and 272, as the minimum binding region for beta-spectrin. Complementary studies on the ankyrin-binding domain of spectrin have been somewhat more conclusive yet have not presented binding in terms of well-phased, integral numbers of spectrin repeats. Thus, the objective of this study was to clearly define and characterize the minimal ankyrin-spectrin binding epitopes. Circular dichroism (CD) wavelength spectra of the aforementioned ankyrin subdomains show that these fragments are 30-60% unstructured. In contrast, human erythroid beta-spectrin repeats 13, 14, 15, and 16 (prepared in all combinations of two adjacent repeats) demonstrated proper folding and stability as determined by CD and tryptophan wavelength and heat denaturation scans. Native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) gel shifts as well as affinity pull-down assays implicated Zu5 and beta-spectrin repeats 14-15 as the minimum binding epitopes. These results were confirmed by analytical ultracentrifugation to sedimentation equilibrium by which a 1:1 complex was obtained if and only if Zu5 was mixed with beta-spectrin constructs containing repeats 14 and 15 in tandem. Surface plasmon resonance yielded a K D of 15.2 nM for binding of beta-spectrin fragments to the ankyrin subdomain Zu5, accounting for all of the binding observed between the intact molecules. Collectively, these results show the 14th and 15th beta-spectrin repeats comprise the minimal, phased region of beta-spectrin, which binds ankyrin at the Zu5 subdomain with high affinity.","tags":["Ankyrins","Binding Sites","Calorimetry","Circular Dichroism","Drug Stability","Epitopes","Erythrocytes","Humans","Models","Molecular","Protein Binding","Protein Conformation","Solutions","Spectrin"],"title":"Molecular epitopes of the ankyrin-spectrin interaction","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Stefan Wuchty","**Jonathan J.

The aforementioned map, generated from genome-scale analyses, has provided a basis for proteomic studies of the parasite; however, such large-scale approaches commonly suffer from undersampling and lack of coverage. The current map bears no exception, containing only one-quarter of the organism's proteins. Inspired by the needs of the current map and the wealth of bioinformatics data, we assembled a map of 19 979 interactions among 2321 proteins in P. falciparum. The resultant map was generated by computationally inferring protein-protein interactions from evolutionarily conserved protein interactions, underlying domain interactions, and experimental observations. To compile this information into a repository of meaningful data, we assessed interaction quality by applying a logistic regression method, which correlated the presence of an interaction with relevant cellular parameters. Interestingly, it was found that sub-networks from different sources are quite dissimilar in their topologies and overlap to a very small extent. Applying Markov clustering, we observe a typical cluster composition, featuring common cellular functions that were previously reported absent, making this map a valuable resource for understanding the biology of this organism.","tags":["Animals","Evolution","Molecular","Malaria","Plasmodium falciparum","Protein Interaction Mapping","Proteome","Proteomics","Protozoan Proteins"],"title":"A draft of protein interactions in the malaria parasite P. falciparum","type":"publication"}]
